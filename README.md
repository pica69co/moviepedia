‚òï What have I learned?

    With this project I was able to further advance my Technical Skills and Knowledge with React and Javascript in general, using Redux Toolkit to persist my Data and RTK Query to easily integrate the whole Application by Dynamically Consuming APIs.
    Material UI (MUI):  I love how simple it is to create Good and Responsive Styles with its suite of UI tools full of fully loaded component libraries. It's also easy to Integrate your Custom Styles with it too.
    Got to learn how to Use and Integrate a Personal AI Assistant on the Application, capable of Interacting with different Options and Making Actions via English Voice Command.
    I learned how to set up and configure ESlint to my needs to maintain Clean and Formatted Structured Code.
    Also learned one of the best Refactoring and Componentization Practices in the actual Market.
